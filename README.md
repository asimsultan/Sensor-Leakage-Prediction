# Sensor-Leakage-Prediction

The given notebook, we have tried to read in the sensor data generated for the leaks in the pipelines for water, kerosene etc and tried to predict how much leakage does takes place in each pipe with respect to the sensor values generated.


The dataset files do not have similar file names that seems to be a bottleneck while renaming the dataframes but everything else works good and quite upto our needs. There are many state of the art solutions currently in progress that are tackling the containerization process
